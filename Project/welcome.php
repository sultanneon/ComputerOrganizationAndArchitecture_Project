    <p class="card-text">Computer Organization and Architecture is the study of internal working, structuring and implementation of a computer system. It is the way of practical implementation which results in realization of architectural specifications of a computer system. Computer architecture and Organization focuses on the function and design of various components necessary to process information digitally. The study of computer architecture and organization focuses on the interface between hardware and software, and emphasizes the structure and behavior of the system. As computer users, we probably do not have to worry about this anymore than we need to know what our cars look like under the hood in order to drive them. We can certainly write high label language programs without understanding how these programs execute. We can use various application packages without understanding how they really work.  But what happens when the program we have written needs to be faster and more efficient or the application we are using does not do precisely what we want? As Computer Science student, we need a basic understanding of computer system itself in order to rectify these problems.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title" style="color: #904428 ">Why we need to study assembly language? </h5>
    <p class="card-text">As it is necessary to know how things work when we are close to the hardware. When we write assembly we understand how the computers hardware works and functions on a low-level. 
Though it's true, we won't find ourself writing next customer's app in assembly, there is still much to gain from learning assembly.
Nowadays assembly language is used primarily for direct hardware manipulation, access to specialized processor instructions, or to address critical performance issues. Typical uses are device drivers, low-level embedded systems, and real-time systems. Assembly language is as close to the processor as we can get as a programmer so a well designed algorithm is blazing which is great for speed optimization. It's all about performance and efficiency. Assembly language gives us complete control over the system's resources. Much like an assembly line, we write code to push single values into registers, deal with memory addresses directly to retrieve values or pointers.

    <p class="card-text">By using this system one user can see the available ticket of route, bus company. Then the user will select one, enter some info and number of sit user want to buy. After that the person will get the receipt and need to pay the cost. At the end of the day it will give the user a raw test of assembly language.</p>

    <p class="card-text">We used assembly language in our project to study internal working, structuring and implementation of the computer system. It is a console based project this is why it is not user friendly enough but we try to give an experience of assembly based application to the user. So, we can say that it will not be able to give high level language based application benefits but able to give assembly language based application taste.
